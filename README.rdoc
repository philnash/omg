= omg

Quick and dirty debugging in Rails.

Sometimes you just want to see whether a method was called. Those times you don't want to write out some rubbish just to see that. Why not just write

  def some_method
    omg!
    # do stuff
  end

When the method is called, in the log you will find

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  OMG!
  some_method called!
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
Or, pass an object to omg! and it will print out the result of the object's inspect method
    
Easy.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
